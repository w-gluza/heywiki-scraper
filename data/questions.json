But that shows only the tip of the iceberg; after 5000 pages it stops, and hasn't even completed the letter A yet. I find that overwhelming and discouraging. Is there any way to find unwatched pages that may be more pertinent?

Admins get the specific number. , it shows the letter A only because I have 60,000 watchlist entries, increasing by 5000 every three days, when the page is regenerated. I monitor the list with an ORES filter and hope to have reduced the special page output to a manageable amount of entries in a few years. If a system administrator one day complains about the size of my watchlist, I'll quote your request as a proposed solution. Heh. Wow, that's impressive!
