2021-10-01,Search within Wikipedia on Safari IOS,"It looks like the search function has disappeared on pages presented in Safari for iOS. I see the offer to use the iOS Wikipedia app, which has a Wikipedia search function, but I miss it in the iOS Safari web presentation. The advantage of using iOS is that hyperlinks from Wikipedia pages can be opened in background tabs for reading later. In the app, a hyperlink takes you to the page directly and you have to read it then. There is no forward button, so if you go back, you can’t go forward again.I wish either the search function would return to the Safari iOS app or that the Wikipedia app for iOS would have tabs with the option of opening a tab in the background. Thanks.",17:20,I still see the search function at the top of the screen when viewing the Wikipedia Home page in Safari for iOS 15.0 in the mobile view and desktop view.,I still see the search function at the top of the screen when viewing the Wikipedia Home page in Safari for iOS 15.0 in the mobile view and desktop view.

2021-10-01,Posting my poems.,Does Wikipedia allow me to post my poems here?,21:54,"No.See , Wikipedia is not a web host. Sadly, no, for the reasons stated above. Nevertheless, I personally urge you to keep writing. Take lessons about writing poetry. If and when you are vaguely famous, someone will write an article about you or your verses in a respected literary journal. Maybe you will even get a chapter in a printed review of early 21st century verse. Then someone might wonder about writing a Wikipedia article about you or a poem you wrote. This would probably take place in around 20 or 30 years' time. Best of luck.","No. See WP:NOT, Wikipedia is not a web host. RudolfRed",21:58
