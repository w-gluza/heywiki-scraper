2020-01-05,Trouble adding images that I have a copyright on,"I am writing a page on Yardley Taylor, it is still in the draft stage. I own a daguerreotype of Yardley and Hannah Taylor that I have a file photograph of, and would like to add it to my page. Plus I have file photos of public domain images of both Yardley Taylor's 1853 map and of him as an old man. When I try to upload these images, a window opens warning that the images might not be allowed because of copyright issues. How do I resolve this issue? most sincerely, Lee1101",18:24,", We give a spooky warning to folks about copyright becuase...well copyright is very important. However, since your works are pre 1923, they are in the public domain, and are no longer copyrighted. As long as you upload them, and check the right boxes and explain that fact, you should be fine. Copyright is not straightforward, so the wording gets tricky. You own one instance of the daguerreotype. You do not own the copyright in the daguerreotype image. The copyright was owned by the original photographer and remained with the photographer or his estate unless it was sold. The copyright then expired and the work passed into the public domain. To complicate matters, your photograph of the daguerreotype is a 'derived work' which is potentially copyrightable. Your copyright in the derived work does not change the copyright status of the work from which it derives. This would for example cover a work by you that added other creative elements e.g., a collage, or a re rendering of some sort. BUT, a 'faithful reproduction of a two dimensional work' has been deemed to have no added creative elements that can be copyrighted. I'm sorry that this is complicated, but it's the law that is complicated, not our procedures. SO: as CaptainEek said, just state that the images are Public Domain.",21:05

Just as a quick point I'm not sure what this is based on, but I'd also assume items that have been intentionally surpressed only viewable by admins and beurocrats/Stewart's would have some similar issues such as revdels and copyvios.

It is fairly easy to look at that list and point them to a couple of possible candidates.

2020-01-10,Incorrect statistics in regards to Brexit,"To whom this may concern, Having read the article on Wikipedia regarding Brexit, I was disappointed as a donor who contributes cash via card transaction to see incorrect/false statistics in relation to one of the most historical political events in British history. The proportion of Leave/Remain in the EU statistics are way off the real, factual figure. Wikipedia states that the proportion of Leave votes is 51.9% which is a piece of grossly incorrect and false information, where the real, factual figure is 52.4% in favour of Leaving the EU. This difference in numerics isn't a small misrepresentation, this is a seismic amount of error. As a financial contributor to Wikipedia, I was disappointed and taken aback by this severely incredible error representing the biggest democratic vote in British history. Having always praised Wikipedia to others, and having depended on this fantastic website with its plethora of rich and endless wealth of information, I am now contemplating as to whether I was right in contributing to Wikipedia, and where do I stand now in terms of future contributions due to the magnitude of this simple error. I have previously sought out 'facts' via Wikipedia and I now question as to whether that information was correct or incorrect, and is Wikipedia really as a reliable source for factual and correct information as initially assumed.May I add that before contacting Wikipedia in this manner, I did attempt to correct this error and replace the false statistical figure of 51.9% to the correct and factual figure of 52.4% but for some unknown reason I was unable to do so hence my writing this in order the article on Brexit be corrected. I am contemplating withholding future contributions due to the fact that what I thought was an incredibly reliable source, has unfortunately just proven itself otherwise.Thank you for your time in taking note of this response regarding said article. Looking forward to hopefully having this error corrected as I am unable to do so myself. And then once again I shall absolutely return to contributing to Wikipedia in the future as I have done so in the past. Thank you once again for your time in this matter and for possibly taking into consideration my concern regarding this historical data.Kindest Regards, Mrs lee Crummay",09:09,"Please address any concerns about the Brexit article to its talk page,.As this is a volunteer project, it is possible for incorrect information to be added, unintentionally or otherwise.If you discuss it with other editors, acan be reached.Please also add that while thank you for donating your donations or lack thereof have no bearing on what occurs with day to day Wikipedia operations.If editors could influence content by donating or withholding donations , this would cease to be a neutral encyclopedia.

There's a lot of fuss around Paul Krugman recently in the media, wanted to see wikipedia to know what's going on.I see no new information, I'm checking article. Multiple edits undone and also deleted! I can't even see what these edit had in them, so allegdly controversial, they were immediately removed from history. I never seen a deleted revision before, yet alone so many deleted revisions! I remember Wikipedia always stayed transparent about their admins' decisions. Whom can I contact and ask to review the deletion of these revisions?",17:47,"You can always review , in this case. For this article, the reason was serious.",17:47

2020-01-11,Draft article by person known IRL,"Hello Mr/Ms Helpdesk.Yesterday an acquiantance I bumped into mentioned that they are looking to get involved in Wikipedia editing and have created a draft article. Their account is not Autoconfirmed, so it is currently waiting in the queue for review. I've looked up the draft and IMHO it is of good quality. Just checking whether there is any conflict of interest if I publish the article? They have not asked me to do this. I would be doing it simply because IMHO the article is worthy on its own merits. Cheers,",22:49,"Hello,. The AFC process is in most cases completely optional. Any autoconfirmed editor may create an article directly in mainspace, or may move a draft to mainspace. The risk if somebody does this without a formal review is that the article may get returned to Draft status, or even deleted, if it is found to be wanting in various ways. If you are confident that the draft in question does meet the basic requirements especially ,and then you may move it to mainspace. COI only really effects users with subjects. Simply knowing another user couldn't be classed as COI we know other users from Wikipedia. As the above says, if it's a suitible draft it can be moved into article space. Best Wishes,",22:49

Best Wishes, Hi I did not know that Wikipedia uses the word Draft to mean something other than its common use both in dictionary and other online services for example in Gmail saving an email as a Draft saves changes to a folder for later edit, it doesn't make it visible to everyone who uses Gmail.

2020-01-12,"After closing an image on a page, the page jumps back to the top instead of what I was just viewing",So I'll be viewing a page and whenever I open then close an image I'll get pushed back to the top of the page. This makes for very frustrating viewing as I'm constantly scrolling back down to where I actually was. I tried doing some research to figure out if there's some setting or browser extension that could be causing this but I can't find anything.

2020-01-12,Where can I ask a question and get an answer,"Sorry if this is a bit snarky, but I'm quite frustrated, and, frankly, quite irritated and this isn't the first time. Several HOURS ago, I looked for, and found, SOME, but VERY limited information on Kenneth Maddy. I've been aware for some time now, that any user is able, in THEORY, to edit any page here but have been unable, for multiple reasons I may touch on here, to be able to figure out HOW to do so, both tonight AND several times in the past. In this case, I know little about the man, so would not even begin to think about editing it. However, when I looked at what was there, it clearly was not anywhere close to what I would consider to be the 'normal', generally excellent Wikipedia page thanks SO much to ALL involved. I admit I didn't read the page in it's entirety since it was obviously not what I was seeking , so SOME of what I was looking for MAY have been buried amongst all the ?hyperbole? that WAS there. Without going back and looking again I've already spent more time than it was worth to me, AND am rather perplexed as to whether it's even appropriate HERE , the info there seemed like it was pretty much ENTIRELY a list of awards and praise he had received as a Senator, to the point of seeming almost like an election campaign piece, or perhaps, an extremely flattering obituary. It was VERY MUCH lacking almost ANY 'typical' biographical information. I lhen looked further, for what I was pretty much expecting to find, which was the often seen comment attached to such articles without being quite this blunt that the article was not up to the normal standards of Wikipedia. THAT would have assured me that SOMEONE had at LEAST noticed it, and it was flagged for needed improvement, eventually. There was ONLY one brief, slightly negative comment there, however, saying simply that the article needed more references. While I would highly agree, my snarky take would be that it needed LOTS of references to LOTS of information that was NOT THERE...So THEN I thought that, despite my many past frustrations with trying to figure out how to EDIT an entry and the same number of times giving up , it shouldn't be NEAR that difficult to simply comment that the article was highly in need of improvement. Silly me. What I DID find, were several no,actually, multiple pages that appeared to be the right direction to go UNTIL one clicked on one, or more, of the often several links that seemed to be associated with almost every sentence or phrase within Wikipedia. Then I almost always discovered, after following several MORE links for each one I DID click on, that where I THOUGHT I had finally discovered the answer MIGHT be hiding... It wasn't. It would be inappropriate to recommend a clean up THERE, because of one reason or another, accompanied by more links to explain why, in more detail...Honestly, it is said that, with lawyers, the fine print giveth, and the fine print taketh away. I'd like to add to general body of common sayings: 'With ?Wikipedians? , the LINK giveth, and MANY, MANY MORE links make you FEEL LIKE your BRAIN has been taken away... Honestly, I've tried to avoid being insulting, but I would not be surprised if NONE of you folks would be capable of sending a friend a new ADDRESS, if you moved, without somehow being able to insert a link.To be fair, links would have helped me in writing this letter. I could have sent many of the multiple 'ah ha's' I THOUGHT I had found, so that SOMEONE might better understand WHY all ultimately led me to dead ends, or 'not applicable's'. If I recall correctly, at some point, I found a link to what appeared to be a GENERAL help page. THAT page consisted of about 20 or 30 links to more specific help pages, several of which looked promising, but each one I looked at consisted of... yeah, that's right... many more links.Now, I have to admit that I realize I'veprobably wasted my time writing this, for multiple reasons mostly since I'm in a writing mood now, and am primarily venting my frustration. However, I'm sort of HOPING that SOMEBODY might read this and understand my point of view just a little bit... since I could not figure out where to send it otherwise, and do not feel like spending most of my Sunday tomorrow, trying to figure it out. If I had, I might have made an effort trying to make it more coherent. Also, I believe I read something a few links ago that said unless I signed in, forget about any replies, but I wouldn't get them anyway ??? For now, it's TIRED and I'm getting late, and I haven't been able to figure out much of the text that appears below this, so I'll cut and paste them for anyone who MIGHT still be following.
